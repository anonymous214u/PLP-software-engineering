#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

- Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems.
- Software Engineering plays a crucial role in technological industries by eneabling creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of the modern life such as in the healthcare sector by enabling the development of applications that streamline clinical operations, improve patient care through data analysis and decision support, manage complex medical records, facilitate remote patient monitoring, and enhance overall efficiency by automating administrative tasks.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

- Development of programming languages sush as C
- Development of software engineering as a discipline in 1960s
- Advent of structured programming in 1970s
- Rise of agile methodologies in 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

- Requirements: involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
- Design: involves creating high level and detailed design of software architecture
- Implementation: involves writing codes and building software according to design specification
- Testing: involves conducting various tests to ensure software meets the standards and functional requirements
- Deployment: involves releasing the software to the public
- Maintenance: involves ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

WATERFALL METHODOLOGIES
- Sequential and structured
- Changes are difficult to incorporate
- Fixed phases i.e requirements -> design -> implementation -> testing -> deployment
- Clearly defined roles, hierarchical
- Examples include construction projects i.e building bridges follows strict plans and regulatory requiremnets
AGILE METHODOLOGIES
- Iterative and flexible
- Continuous cycle  i.e plan -> design -> develop -> test -> review
- Highly adaptable to changes
- Cross-functional , collaborative teams
- example include ecormerce platform i.e an online store requiring frequent updates based on market trends

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

- Software developer: responsible for writing code and implementating software solutions
- Quality assurance engineer: ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans
- Project manager: oversees planning, execution and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

- IDEs and VCS enhances productivity, collaboration and code quality by providing developers with features such as code editors, version control, debugging tools and automated testing capabilities.
- Example of IDEs include: visual studio, eclipse
- Example of VCS include: Git, subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

- Changing requirements: requirements change during development cycle leading to scope creep and project delays
- Tight deadlines: pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and comromised quality
- Technical debt: accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions. Technical debt can impede future development effort and increase maintenance costs.
STRATEGIES TO OVERCOME THESE CHALLENGES
- Effective communication
- Agile methodologies
- Prioritization of tasks
- Regular reassesment of project goals and timelines

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

- Unit testing: testing individual components or modules of the software
- Integration testing: testing interactions between different components or subsystems
- System testing: testing an entire software system as a whole
- Acceptance testing: testing software system against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs
IMPORTANCE:
- Quality assurance measures such as code reviews, automated testing and continuous integration help identity and fix defects early in the development process leading to higher quality software products

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

- Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining prompts to effectively communicate with AI models to achieve desired outputs
- Enhances AI Performance: Well-structured prompts improve the accuracy and relevance of AI-generated responses.
- Increases Efficiency: A precise prompt reduces the need for multiple iterations, saving time and computational resources.
- Optimizes Output Quality: By using structured instructions, users can refine tone, format, and level of detail in responses.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

- Tell me about AI: broad and lacks a purpose
- Summarize the importance of AI in daily life: the AI is able to intepret the question asked from the prompt by narrowing the prompt to importance of AI rather than a broad reply.
